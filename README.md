# SightLife-Patient-Data-Project

**Introduction and Description of Project**

This database holds extensive clinical data from patients who've received corneal transplant surgeries from hospitals in the developing areas of Bhubaneswar and Vizag in India. While corneal transplant surgery remains an effective choice for patients with advanced corneal disease, the long-term prognosis of these allografts is especially diminished for developing countries. Since the patient records are collected from tertiary hospitals, this data will provide a good indication of the level of patient burden within developing areas such as these secondary cities in India.

**Data Sources**

This data set contains corneal transplant clinical records from 1513 patients at the LV Prasad Eye Institute of Bhubaneswar and Vizag in India. The LVPEI Institute in Bhubaneswar and Vizag are both tertiary level hospitals for eye and cornea health in their respective cities. These patient records hold a collective of 7-10 years of data, mostly from local patients within a 200-kilometer radius from the hospital.

**Goal of Project**

The goal of this database is to identify trends that point to barriers of access or poor clinical results, in hopes of bettering post-transplant regiments to optimize patient outcomes for corneal transplants. This database will be utilized to enrich post-transplant research, create better post-transplant protocols for all clinical settings, and to build a clinical algorithm that predicts 1-year post-transplant outcomes.
